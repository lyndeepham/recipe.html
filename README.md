    <h2>What do do next in the future?</h2>
    <p>
        In the near future, you can be able to add more fruits, and try different flavors to taste. You can try pinnaple, mango, bannna, and so much more. Smoothies are my favorite because they are so good, so maybe you should give a try next time. :)
